<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>The Life of Anthony Pascarella</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>
    
  <h2>Writing, to me, is perhaps one of the most human fields of study. Each word written on a page was carefully chosen by somebody for a specific purpose. Each passage has its own style, its own voice, depending on who wrote it. Most importantly, writing allows us the infinite ability to explore anything we want. There's no shame in it; it's our own voice, given form on a page. Whether it's writing a massive book or simply jotting down a few quick notes on a spare scrap of paper, those words are a testament to our lasting ability to articulate our thoughts and feelings in a way that is completely our own. I think it is that beauty that drew me writing in the first place. It was a space completely my own, where I was free to take risks, to make mistakes. It seems only natural that I follow that path into my career, making a living out of making art.</h2>

<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path along which you now stand).--> 
    
<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Family and Home</h1>

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->
    
<div class="row">

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."--> 
    
<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>When I was younger, I thought family was strictly those who you're related to. I thought "love" could only refer to someone who shared a relative with you, until you were old enough to get married. But the odler I got, the more I realized this simply isn't true. Family is more than just blood. It can definitely be a part, sure, but it is not exclusive. Family has come to include anyone that I care deeply about, so much that it hurts sometimes when I am not around them. It is anyone whom I would give anything to just to make them happy. I don't use "I love you" lightly. I reserve it only for those I consider family.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life? 

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

  <h2>I know this video is a super nerdy choice, but I remember being blown away after watching it in my seventh grade science class. My teacher was pretty eccentric and he was a huge proponent of using technology for the good of scientific study. He championed using iPads on projects, using laptops to take notes, using smartphone apps to gather data. This video was meant to give our young, middle school minds a look at the possibility of technology in the near future. Ever since then, I have been obsessed with the development of technology. I came to Pitt thinking I wanted to major in computer science, but I soon learned that the coding life wasn't exactly for me. After having minor existential crisis, I was introduced to the Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major, which blended what I loved about computer science and digital design with English and creative writing. I fell in love with the possibilities the major offered, and I haven't looked back since.

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Community</h1>
    </div>
   
    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>I don't think I ever gave this question much thought before. I've never felt like I belong to any one "community", in the sense that it is presented here. I went to high school with other kids in my area. I go to college now with people from all over the world, tied together by the common theme of our shared university. I tend not to tie myself down to one description, to one "community". I belong to many, I suppose. My friends, for sure, both those from home and here at Pitt. My family, especially since we've spent so much time over the past few months under the same roof. Aside from that, I don't go out of my way to socialize much. My interests and hobbies are pretty niche, so it sometimes isn't easy finding people that share them. Usually, I turn to those within my friend or family circles. Does it bother me that I'm not part of a rigid, structuralized community? Sometimes, but not really. I tend to make my own path in life, when possible. I've found that it takes away some of the pressure of fitting in.</h2>

Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">   
  <h2>I've always been the bookish kid, ever since preschool. I remember spending a lot of our dedicated playtime pretending I was writing novels, or memos, or emails like my mom does all the time when she works from home. My parents always pushed both my sister and I to put our education above everything else. Sometimes, having that drive was nice. We always had their support when it came to schoolwork. Other times, it could become quite overwhelming. I didn't let it faze me, though. I always pushed myself to be better, even when the role of my parents lessened as I grew older. In elementary school, I always studied for the spelling bees. I always completed my work on time and made sure it was done to the best of my abilities. In high school, I devoted time to studying and completing projects. I always took advanced classes, earning credits before I even entered college. And now that I'm here, a place in time that a younger me could scarcely conceptualize, let alone imagine, I feel as if it all paid off. Sure, I'm not an engineering student, nor am I pursuing medicine, but to me, eductaion is more than just perserveering through the difficulty of your classes. True education, something that I feel is rare in many classes, is enjoying the process of learning. It's voluntarily engaging in subjects that interest you, that drive you to constantly do better, to be better. Even though the road to where I sit now is long and riddled with many challenges, I think the outcome will be worth it.</h2>
